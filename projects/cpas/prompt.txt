I need to create a dataset for a toxicity prediction specifically for Cryoprotectant Agents (CPAs). 

For the following paper, extract and output ALL mentioned CPA mixtures with their experimental data. 

Important guidelines:
1. Extract ALL CPA compositions mentioned in the paper
2. For each composition, include all chemical components with their properties (name, SMILES, concentrations)
3. Include all experimental conditions (temperature, exposure time, cell type)
4. Include all viability/toxicity measurements
5. If SMILES structures are not provided in the paper, use your knowledge to provide the correct SMILES for common CPAs
6. Include any quantitative toxicity metrics (LC50, EC50, etc.) if available
7. Add relevant notes for any additional context

Please analyze the attached PDF and extract the data according to the schema.
